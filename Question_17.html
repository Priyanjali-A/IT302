		XML permits document authors to create markup (i.e., a text-based notation for describing data) for virtually any type of information, 
		enabling them to create entirely new markup languages for describing any type of data, such as mathematical formulas, software configuration instructions, 
		chemical molecular structures, music, news, recipes and financial reports. XML describes data in a way that human beings can understand and computers can process.
	</p>

		The next generation of the web is being built on an XML foundation, enabling you to develop more sophisticated web-based applications. 
		XML allows you to assign meaning to what would otherwise be random pieces of data. As a result, programs can “understand” the data they manipulate. 
		For example, a web browser might view a street address in a simple web page as a string of characters without any real meaning. In an XML document, 
		however, this data can be clearly identified (i.e., marked up) as an address.
