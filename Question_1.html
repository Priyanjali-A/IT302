	<p>A network is defined as the connection of at least two computer systems, either by a <span id="first">cable or a wireless connection.</span> 
         The simplest network is a combination of two computers connected by a cable. This type of network is called a <span id="second">peer-to-peer network</span>. 
         There is no hierarchy in this network; both participants have equal privileges. 
         Each computer has access to the data of the other device and can share resources such as <u>disk space, applications or peripheral devices (printers, etc.).</u>
